# Asciify
A fun tool which converts images to ascii art versions of them.

I put all the front end code into a single HTML file that way only a single large
file needs to be served rather than multiple asset files like it would normally
be.

The tool can be accessed [here](https://asciify.falconca.ca) and it's mostly
straight forward to use (Instructions can be found on the page).
